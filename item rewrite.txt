Plans for Item Rewrite

--- TYPE ---
The type shall only hold one main model.
Old cits which introduce multiple sub models will be baked into the main model.
Need to explain in docs that the cit replaces the main model regardless of changing it or it's sub models.
Sub model compatability between multiple cits will be handled by future predicate condition.

--- MODEL LOADING ---
All models loaded by citresewn will now have cit resewn's namespace and full absolute paths in the asset manager(defined formatting).
Formatting is as follows: `citresewn:<NAMESPACE>/<PATH FROM NAMESPACE>`

Provide full api for types for loading models to be used by more than the item type.


--- RENDERING ---
Completely move cit resolution from getModel to the rendering paths that call it.

CrackParticle:<init>:42
modifyarg with captured context, forced single Mode.FIXED display mode.
extract particle sprite.

ItemEntityRenderer:render:68
modifyvar bakedModel, forced Mode.GROUND display mode.
needed for extra rendering transformations for item entity.

ItemRenderer:renderGuiItemModel:219
modifyvar model with captured context, forced Mode.GUI display mode

ItemRenderer:renderItem:121
modifyvar model with captured context, extract display mode from captured renderMode


--- BAKED MODEL FETCHING FROM TYPE ---
Must include display mode context in the getter so you could set the same CIT to different cache display modes.
