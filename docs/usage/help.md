# Need Help / Found a Bug / Questions
### A resourcepack is not loading:
Check the logs, they are more useful than you think!

### Non [a-z0-9/._-] character in path of location:
The resourcepack you're using is not following minecraft's pack formatting standards.  
Contact the pack author and inform them. In the mean time you can enable broken paths in the config (try to avoid doing this please).

### Anything else:
Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues) or DM @SHsuperCM on the Fabric discord server for anything CIT Resewn!
