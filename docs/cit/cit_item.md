# CIT Item
<h6>Note that features marked in <em>italics</em> are unique to CIT Resewn.</h6>

This page applies to CITs marked with `type=item`(optional as `item` is the default type).

CIT Item replaces the appearance of:

 - Items in inventories
 - Items in the hotbar
 - Held Items
 - Items worn in the head slot
 - Items in item frames
 - Dropped items
 - Tossed projectiles(snowball, egg, enderpearl, splash/lingering potions, etc..)

The replacement can either be a full model(`.json`) by declaring a `model` or a model that is generated by 

## Conditions

### Target
The CIT must match the item that has its appearance changed.

### Overrides
The `items` condition is required for this type. [**(the CIT can be named after an item in the namespace to add this automatically)**]{For example: &#10 diamond_hoe.properties}


## Effects

| Key                         | Value Type        | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**`texture`**]{Aliases: &#10 tile|right} | [**[Texture Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.png`)**]{Examples: &#10 texture=./my_textures/stick_texture.png &#10 texture=assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit/item_textures/texture &#10 texture=minecraft:item/texture.png|right} | Replaces the item's model with one generated by the resolved texture. [**The parent of the generated model is the model associated with the first item in `items`.**]{This is what allows sword texture replacements to inherit the 'handheld' type of model for example.} | None |
| `model` | [**[Model Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.json`)**]{Examples: &#10 model=./my_models/stick_model.json &#10 model=assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit/item_models/model &#10 model=minecraft:item/model.json|right} | Replaces the item's model with one described by the resolved json. [This uses the vanilla model formatting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Model#Item_models). <br> Models loaded by this property also gain the ability to load relative assets for textures, parents and overrides by prefixing `./`. <br> When `texture` is also declared, the texture is used to replace all of the textures in the model loaded by the json. | None |
| `texture.`[**<ins>  sub  </ins>**]{stub|right} | [**[Texture Asset](/cit/cit_base/#asset-resolution) <br> (`.png`)**]{Examples: &#10 texture=./my_textures/stick_texture.png &#10 texture=assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit/item_textures/texture &#10 texture=minecraft:item/texture.png|right} | stub | None |
