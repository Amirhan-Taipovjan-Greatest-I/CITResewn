# Global Properties
<h6>Note that features marked in <em>italics</em> are unique to CIT Resewn.</h6>

Commonly known as `cit.properties`, Global Properties is not a cit but rather a config that is set 
for the entire resourcepack.

## Location

The pack's global properties can be either (ordered by priority. if one exists, the rest are ignored):

`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit.properties`  
`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit.properties`  
`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit.properties`

## Properties

All properties (and `cit.properties` itself) are optional.
