Welcome to CIT Resewn's docs!

## CIT Resewn
is a fabric mod written and maintained by [SHsuperCM](https://bit.ly/3tqu4Z1).  
  
The mod provides a modern implementation of MCPatcher's Custom Item Textures, 
a mod that gave resourcepacks the ability to modify items' appearances based on specified conditions.  
Optifine later adopted MCPatcher's features and have maintained the only working version of it.  
CIT Resewn is my shot at providing support for cit outside of optifine.

## Documentation
These **(VERY WIP)** docs should hopefully provide pack and mod authors with the information they need in 
order to work with cits.

## Need Help / Found a Bug / Questions
### A resourcepack is not loading:
Check the logs, they are more useful than you think!

### Non [a-z0-9/._-] character in path of location:
The resourcepack you're using is not following minecraft's pack formatting standards.  
Contact the pack author and inform them. In the mean time you can enable broken paths in the config (try to avoid doing this please).

### Anything else:
Feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues) for anything CIT Resewn!
