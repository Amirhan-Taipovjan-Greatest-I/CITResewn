Welcome to CIT Resewn's docs!

## CIT Resewn
is a fabric mod written and maintained by [SHsuperCM](https://bit.ly/3tqu4Z1).  
  
The mod provides a modern implementation of MCPatcher's Custom Item Textures, 
a mod that gave resourcepacks the ability to modify items' appearances based on specified conditions.  
Optifine later adopted MCPatcher's features and have maintained the only working version of it.  
CIT Resewn is my shot at providing support for cit outside of Optifine.

## What the Doc Doin'
These **(WIP)** docs should hopefully provide pack and mod authors with the information they need in 
order to work with CITs and CIT Resewn.

*Features written in italics are unique to CIT Resewn and won't be in other implementations.*
