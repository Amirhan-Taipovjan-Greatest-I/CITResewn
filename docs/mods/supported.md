are some mods that it supports.

You got some mod that isn't working with CIT Resewn?

## Explicit Support

CIT Resewn is written specifically to allow using these mods.

### [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
Adds a custom config screen for CIT Resewn.  
Accessed through Mod Menu or by running `/citresewn config`.

### [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)
CIT Resewn is listed and a button is added to access the Cloth Config screen.

## Incompatible

### [Canvas](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer)
The game crashes with both present.

Support is planned eventually.

<br>
## Recommended

Some mods that should natively work with CIT Resewn.

### [LambdAurora's Optifine Alternatives List](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/)

This list(and CIT Resewn) is an effort to ditch Optifine in favor of more dynamic, 
open sourced and modder friendly replacements. One of Optifine's biggest problems 
is its development. After being so popular for such a long time it is still being 
developed by a single person. By splitting its features across multiple developers, 
more attention can be given to each thing. I am going to be focusing on CIT, thus 
giving it the love it deserves. Many brilliant devs are working on stuff like 
performance, shaders, connected textures, dynamic lights, sky boxes, even zoom. 
They will have my full support.  
LambdAurora has compiled these mods into a nice, organized list. Thank you for that!
